/*
 * Here, we're using a hash map to store the different resources
 * loaded from a single archive.
 * It's an open hash map, so it handles collisions gracefully.
 * Each entry in the map is essentially a pointer to a linked list.
 * We're not worried about dynamic allocation here, because resources
 * will only be loaded and unloaded during load times.
 *
 * The arclists themselves are stored in a linked list. This will
 * be searched linearly; there won't be enough archives loaded to
 * worry about this.
 *
 * Outside code will interface with this system using strings. Again,
 * no reason to worry about performance overhead. When a piece of
 * code needs to keep track of a resource for later retrieval, it will
 * store the pointer to the resource structure.
 *
 * Unloading a resource will free the memory used for its data.
 * Unloading an archive will free the memory used for all of its loaded
 * resources, all of its resource entries, and its arclist structure.
